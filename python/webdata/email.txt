Subject: Re: Gift Voucher Issue

Dear Matt,

Sometimes the website does not pick up on the voucher codes correctly, it is a problem that we are trying to fix.

Please call 01670 516151 between 9-5 Monday to Friday and I will be able to put the order through for you.

I have a gift voucher: TONEILL001 but it is not recognised by your system (see attached).

Can you please check on this for me? The voucher was purchased 19-08-2015.
